## Materials and Methods

### Grid preparation

ER-HoxA9 cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS,
penicillin/streptomycin, SCF, and estrogen [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2016.08.057] at
37C and 5% CO2. 120h prior to grid freezing cells were washed twice in PBS and
cultured in the same medium, except without estrogen. Differentiation was
verified by staining with Hoechst-dye and insepction of nuclear morphology.
Cells were then counted and diluted to 1^106 cells/ml. Grids ( either 200 mesh
copper grids, with a sillicone-oxide and 2um holes with a 2um spacing or 200
mesh gold grids with a thin gold film and 2 um holes in 2um sapcing) were
glow-discharged from both sides using a 15 mA for 45s . 3.5 ul of cells suspension
was added to grids on the thin-film side and grids were automatically blotted
from the back-side using a GP2 cryoplunger (Leica) for ... s and rapidly plunged
into liquid ethane at -185°C. 

### FIB-milling

Grids were loaded into a Acquilos 2 FIB/SEM  microscope with a stage cooled to
-190°C. Grids were sputter-coated with platinum for 15s at 45 mA and then coated
with a layer of platinum-precursor by opening the GIS-valve for 45s. An overview
of the grid was created by montaging SEM images and isolated cells at the center
of gridsquares were selected for FB-milling. Lamella were generated
automatically using the AutoTEM software, with the following parameters:

- Milling angle: 20°
- Rough milling: 3.2 µm thickness, 0.5nA current
- Medium milling: 1.8 µm thickness, 0.3nA current, 1.0° overtilt
- Fine milling: 1.0 µm tchickness, 0.1nA current, 0.5° overtilt
- Finer milling: 700 nm thickness, 0.1nA curent, 0.2° overtilt
- Polish 1: 450nm thickness, 50 pA current
- Polish 2: 200nm thickness, 30 pA current

This resulted in 6-8 um wide lamella with
150-250nm thickness as determined by FIB-imaging of the lamella edge.

### Data collection

Grids were loaded into a Krios Titan TEM operated at 300 keV. The microscope was
setup with a cross-grating grid on the stageby setting the beam-diameter to 900
nm, resulting in the beam being completely visible in the camera. To establish
fringe-free conditions, the "Fine eucentric" procedure of serialEM was used to
move a square of the cross-grating grid to the eucentric position of the
microscope. The effective defocus was then set to 2 um, using the "autofocus"
routine of serialEM. The objective focus of the microscope was changed until no
fringes were visible. The stage was then moved in Z until images had a apparent
defocus of 2 um. The difference in stage Z-position between the eucentric and
fringe-free conditions was calculate d and noted to move other areas into
fringe-free condition.

Low magnification montages were used to find lamella and lamella that were
sufficiently thin and free of contamination were selected for automated data
collection. The corners of the lamella were manually annotated in SerialEM and
translated into Beam-Imageshift values using SerialEm calibration. A hexagonal
patter of beam-imageshift positions was calculated that covered the area between
he four corners in a serpentine way, with a sqrt(3) * 400 nm horizontal spacing
and 800 nm vertical spacing. Exposures were then taking at each position with a
30 e/A total dose. After each exposure that defocus was estimated using the
ctffind function of SerialEM and the focus for th next exposure was corrected by
the difference between the estimated focus and the desired defocus of 800 um.
Also after each exposure the deviation of the beam from the center of the camera
was measured and corrected using the "CenterBeamFrom IMage" command of SerialEM.

After datacollection a 20s exposure at 2250x magnification of the lamella at
200um defocus was taken for visualization purposes.

### Data pre-processing

Movies were gain-corrected and motion-corrected using a custom version of
unblur. To avoid influence of the beam-edge on motion-correction only a quarter
of the movie in the center of the camera was considered for calculation of the
estimated motion. After movie frames were aligned and summed a mask for the
illuminated area was calculated by lowpass filtering the image at ... A,
thresholding the image at 10% of the maximal value and then lowpass filtering
the mask at ... A. This mask was then used to replace un-illuminated area with
gaussian noise, with the same mean and standard deviation as the illuminated
area. A custom version of the unblur program implementing this procedure is
available at (TODO). 
The contrast-transfer function (CTF) was estimated using ctffind, searching
between 0.02 and 2 um defocus. 

### 2DTM

The search template was generated from the cryo-EM structure of the mouse large
ribosomal subunit (PDB 6SWA) using the simulate program in cisTEM [cite]. The ... subunit was deleted from the model and the
simulate program of the cisTEM suite was used to calculate an density map from
the atomic coordinates. The match_template program was used to search for this
template in the preprocessed images, using 1.5 deg angular step in out-of-plane
angles and 1.0 deg in-plane. 21 defocus planes in 200nm steps centered around
the defocus estimates by ctffind were searches. Matches were defined as peaks
above a threshold calulated according to .. .(7.75 for most images).
