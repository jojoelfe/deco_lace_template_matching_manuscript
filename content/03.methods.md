## Materials and Methods

### Grid preparation

ER-HoxA9 cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS,
penicillin/streptomycin, SCF, and estrogen [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2016.08.057] at
37C and 5% CO2. 120h prior to grid preparation, cells were washed twice in PBS
and cultured in the same medium except without estrogen. Differentiation was
verified by staining with Hoechst-dye and inspection of nuclear morphology.
Cells were then counted and diluted to $1\cdot10^6$ cells/ml. Grids ( either 200 mesh
copper grids, with a sillicone-oxide and 2um holes with a 2um spacing or 200
mesh gold grids with a thin gold film and 2 um holes in 2um spacing) were
glow-discharged from both sides using a 15 mA for 45s . 3.5 ul of cell
suspension was added to grids on the thin-film side and grids were automatically
blotted from the back side using a GP2 cryoplunger (Leica) for 8 s and rapidly
plunged into liquid ethane at -185°C. 

### FIB-milling

Grids were loaded into a Acquilos 2 FIB/SEM  microscope with a stage cooled to
-190°C. Grids were sputter-coated with platinum for 15s at 45 mA and then coated
with a layer of platinum-precursor by opening the GIS-valve for 45s. An overview
of the grid was created by montaging SEM images and isolated cells at the center
of gridsquares were selected for FB-milling. Lamella were generated
automatically using the AutoTEM software, with the following parameters:

- Milling angle: 20°
- Rough milling: 3.2 µm thickness, 0.5nA current
- Medium milling: 1.8 µm thickness, 0.3nA current, 1.0° overtilt
- Fine milling: 1.0 µm tchickness, 0.1nA current, 0.5° overtilt
- Finer milling: 700 nm thickness, 0.1nA curent, 0.2° overtilt
- Polish 1: 450nm thickness, 50 pA current
- Polish 2: 200nm thickness, 30 pA current

This resulted in 6-8 um wide lamella with
150-250nm thickness as determined by FIB-imaging of the lamella edge.

### Data collection

Grids were loaded into a Krios Titan TEM (Thermore Fisher) operated at 300 keV
and equipped with a BioQuantum energy filter (Gatan) and K3 camera (Gatan). The
microscope was aligned using a cross-grating grid on the stage. Prior to each
session we carefully performed the Image/Beam calibration in nanoprobe. Then we
set the magnification to a pixel size of 1.76Å and condensed the beam to ~
900nm diameter, resulting in the beam being completely visible on the camera.
To establish fringe-free conditions, the "Fine eucentric" procedure of serialEM
was used to move a square of the cross-grating grid to the eucentric position of
the microscope. The effective defocus was then set to 2 um, using the
"autofocus" routine of serialEM. The objective focus of the microscope was
changed until no fringes were visible. The stage was then moved in Z until
images had a apparent defocus of 2 um. The difference in stage Z-position
between the eucentric and fringe-free conditions was then used to move other
areas into fringe-free condition.

Low magnification montages were used to find lamella and lamella that were
sufficiently thin and free of contamination were selected for automated data
collection. Vverview images of each lamella were taken at 2250x magnification
(39Å pixel-sixe). The corners of the lamella in the overview image were manually
annotated in SerialEM and translated into Beam-Imageshift values using SerialEM
calibration. A hexagonal pattern of Beam-Imageshift positions was calculated
that covered the area between the four corners in a serpentine way, with a
sqrt(3) * 400 nm horizontal spacing and 800 nm vertical spacing. Exposures were
then taken at each position with a 30 e/Å2 total dose. After each exposure that
defocus was estimated using the ctffind function of SerialEM and the focus for
the next exposure was corrected by the difference between the estimated focus
and the desired defocus of 800 nm. Furthermore, after each exposure the
deviation of the beam from the center of the camera was measured and corrected
using the "CenterBeamFromImage" command of SerialEM.

After datacollection a 20s exposure at 2250x magnification of the lamella at
200um defocus was taken for visualization purposes. A python script implementing
this procedure is available at [Link to repo].

### Data pre-processing

To avoid influence of the beam-edge on motion-correction only a quarter
of the movie in the center of the camera was considered for calculation of the
estimated motion. After movie frames were aligned and summed a mask for the
illuminated area was calculated by lowpass filtering the image at 100Å,
thresholding the image at 10% of the maximal value and then lowpass filtering
the mask at 100Å. This mask was then used to replace un-illuminated area with
gaussian noise, with the same mean and standard deviation as the illuminated
area. A custom version of the unblur program implementing this procedure is
available at (TODO). 
The contrast-transfer function (CTF) was estimated using ctffind, searching
between 0.02 and 2 um defocus. 

### 2DTM

The search template was generated from the cryo-EM structure of the mouse large
ribosomal subunit (PDB 6SWA) using the simulate program in cisTEM [cite]. The
atomic coordinates corresponding to Epb1 were deleted from the model and the
simulate program of the cisTEM suite was used to calculate an density map from
the atomic coordinates. The match_template program was used to search for this
template in the preprocessed images, using 1.5° angular step in out-of-plane
angles and 1.0° in-plane. 11 defocus planes in 20nm steps centered around
the defocus estimates by ctffind were searched. Matches were defined as peaks
above a threshold of 7.75, which was chosen based on a one false positive per
tile criterium [cite].
