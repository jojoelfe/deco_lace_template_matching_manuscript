![Statistics of 2DTM on lamella imaged using DeCo-LACE (A) Number of matches of
each lamella (B) Distribution of matches per tile in each lamella. Only tiles
with two or more matches were included (C) Distribution of SNRs in each lamella
(D) For each lamella an average of all tiles is shown. Overlaid is a scatterplot
of all matches in these tiles according to their in-tile coordinates.
Scatterplot is color according to the SNR. There are no matches in the top
circle-circle intersection due to radiation damage from previous exposures.](tikz:matching_stat){#fig:matching_stat}
