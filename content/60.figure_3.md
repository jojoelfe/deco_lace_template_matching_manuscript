![Statistics of 2DTM on lamella imaged using DeCo-LACE (A) Number of detected targets in
each lamella (B) Distribution of targets per tile in each lamella. Only tiles
with two or more detected targets were included (C) Distribution of SNRs in each lamella
(D) For each lamella an average of all tiles is shown. Overlaid is a scatterplot
of all detected targets in these tiles according to their in-tile coordinates.
Scatterplot is colored according to the 2DTM SNR. There are no detected targets in the top
circle-circle intersection due to radiation damage from previous exposures. (E) 2D histogram of number of detected targets as a function of beam-image shift (F) Mean 2DTM SNR as a function of beam-image shift](tikz:matching_stat){#fig:matching_stat}
