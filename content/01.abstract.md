## Abstract {.page_break_before}



Localization of biomolecules inside a cell is an important goal of biological imaging. Fluorescence microscopy can localize biomolecules inside whole cells and tissues, but its ability to count biomolecules and accuracy of the spatial coordinates is limited by the wavelength of visible light. On the other hand, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) provides highly accurate position and orientation information of biomolecules but is often limited to small fields of view inside a cell, providing only limited biological context. In this study we use a new data-acquisition scheme called “Beam-Imageshift for Large Area Cryo-Electron microscopy” (BILACE) to collect high-resolution cryo-EM data over entire sections (100 – 200 nm thick lamellae) of neutrophil-like mouse cells, representing roughly 1% of the total cellular volume. We use 2D template matching to determine localization and orientation of the large ribosomal subunit in these sections. Furthermore, we use 2D template matching to test detected targets for the presence of the small ribosomal subunit and used the relative orientations of the ribosomes to assign them to polysomes. These results provide "maps" of translational activity across sections of mammalian cells. We envision that using this high-throughput cryo-EM data collection approach together with 2D template matching will advance visual proteomics to complement other single-cell "omics" techniques, such as flow-cytometry and single-cell sequencing.
