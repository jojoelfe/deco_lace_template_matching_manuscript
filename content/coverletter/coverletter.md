Please find enclosed our manuscript titled "Defocus Corrected Large Area Cryo-EM (DeCo-LACE) for Label-Free Detection of Molecules across Entire Cell Sections" by Elferich, et al..

Advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have made it possible to detect biomolecular complexes inside vitrified sections of cells solely by their atomic structure. Therefore, cryo-EM could be used to quantitatively describe cell state by identifying the number, location, and orientation of the contained biomolecules. This concept is often referred to as "visual proteomics". However, there are still many challenges that need to be solved before this vision can become reality. One of these challenges is that the field of view at the magnifications required to capture atomic detail is much smaller than cells, which limits throughput and images of the cell lack important biological context. 

In our manuscript we describe a new data collection approach, DeCo-LACE, that allows for high-throughput acquisition of cryo-EM data at atomic detail and, most importantly, results in seamless montages of an entire cell section. The data therefore capture the full biological context. We show that this data is of high enough quality to detect ribosomes in the cell slices using 2D template matching (2DTM). The results provide a 3D map of ribosomes within these cell slices and from their orientation reveal association to membranes or translation of a common mRNA. We believe that this technological advancement will result in new discoveries that could not be obtained by any other method. For example, in the proof-of-principle imaging of mammalian neutrophil-like cells we found an unexpected population of granules containing vesicles. 2DTM demonstrated that some of these vesicles contain ribosomes, which could hint towards a new class of extracellular vesicles containing translating units.

We hope that you will agree with us that this technological advancement is of interest for the broad readership of eLife.
