![DeCo-LACE approach (A) Graphic demonstrating the data-collection strategy for
DeCo-LACE. The electron beam is condensed to a diameter $D_{Beam}$ that allows captured of
the whole illuminated area on the camera. Beam-image shift along X and Y
($BIS_X$,$$BIS_Y$) is used to scan the whole lamella
(B) Diagram of the collection algorithm
(C) Example overview image of a lamella with the designated acquisition
positions and the used beam diameter indicated with red circles. Scalebar corresponds to 1 Î¼m.
(D+E) Representative micrographs takne with a condensed beam at eucentric focus
(D) or fringe-free focus (E). Scalebar corresponds to 100 nm.
(F) Boxplot of defocus measured by ctffind of micrographs taken by the DeCo-LACE
approach on four lamellae images at eucentric focus and four lamellae imaged with
fringe-free focus.
