### 2D-Template matching can be used to find ribosomal subunits in cryo-FIB thinned lamella of mammalian cells

To test whether we could detect individual ribosomes in mammalian cells we
prepared cryo-lamella of mouse neutrophil-like cells. Low-magnification images
of these lamellas clearly shows cellular features consistent with a
neutrophil-like phenotype, mainly a segmented nucleus and a plethora of
membrane-organelles, corresponding to the granules and secretory vesicles of
neutrophils. We then proceeded to acquire micrographs on this lamella with a
defocus of 0.5-1.0 um, 30 e/A2/s exposure and 1.5 A pixelsize. We manually
selected multiple locations in the lamella and focused using standard low-dose
techniques, i.e. by first ensuring correct focus by imaging a sacrifical area.
The resoluting micrographs showed no signs of crystalline ice and had thon-rings
to  resolution, indicating successfull vitrification. 

We used an atomic model of the 60S mouse ribosomal subunit  (6SWA) for 2D
template matching. In a subset of images the distribution of cross-correlation
scores significantly exceeded the distribution expected from non-signifcant
matching. By using the criterion described by for thresholding potential matches
we found that in images of cytosolic ompartments we found evidence of 10-500
ribosomes in the imaged area.
