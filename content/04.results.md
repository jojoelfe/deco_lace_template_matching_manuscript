### 2D-Template matching can be used to find ribosomal subunits in cryo-FIB thinned lamella of mammalian cells

To test whether we could detect individual ribosomes in mammalian cells we
prepared cryo-lamella of mouse neutrophil-like cells. Low-magnification images
of these lamellas clearly shows cellular features consistent with a
neutrophil-like phenotype, mainly a segmented nucleus and a plethora of
membrane-organelles, corresponding to the granules and secretory vesicles of
neutrophils. We then proceeded to acquire micrographs on this lamella with a
defocus of 0.5-1.0 um, 30 e/A2/s exposure and 1.5 A pixelsize. We manually
selected multiple locations in the lamella and focused using standard low-dose
techniques, i.e. by first ensuring correct focus by imaging a sacrifical area.
The resoluting micrographs showed no signs of crystalline ice and had thon-rings
to  resolution, indicating successfull vitrification. 

We used an atomic model of the 60S mouse ribosomal subunit  (6SWA) for 2D
template matching. In a subset of images the distribution of cross-correlation
scores significantly exceeded the distribution expected from non-signifcant
matching(Figure 1B). In the resulting scaled maximum-intensity maps, clear peaks
with SNR thresholds up to 10 were apparent (Figure 1C). By using the criterion
described by for thresholding potential matches we found that in images of
cytosolic ompartments we found evidence of 10-500 ribosomes in the imaged areas.
Notably we found no matches in images that were taken in the nuclear
compartment. In the cytosolic areas we found a drastically different number of
matches, In somer areas we found only ~ 50 matches er image area, corresponding
to a concentration of..., while in another area we found more than 500 matches,
corresponding to a concentration of ... .

### cryo-EMILIA for 2D imaging of whole lamella

In order to obtain high-resolution data for complete lamella we used a new
approach for data collection. This approach uses three key strategies: (1)
ensures that every electron that exposes the sample is collected on the camera
(2) uses beam-image shift to precisely and quickly raster the surface of the
lamella and (3) uses a focusing strategy that does not rely on a sacrificial
area.

To ensure that every electron exposing the sample was captured by the detector,
we focused the electron beam so that the entire beam was placed on the detector.
During canonical low-dose imaging the microscope is configured so that the focal
plan is identical to the eucentric plane of the specimen stage. This leaves the
C2 aperture out of focus, resulting in ripples at the edge of the beam (Figure
2B). While these ripples are low-resolution features that might not interfere
with 2D template matching, which is designed to be robust to low-resolution
noise, we also tested collecting data under a condition where the C2 aperture is
in focus (Figure 2C). 

We then centered a lamella under the electron beam and used beam-image shift of
the microscope to systematically raster the whole surface of the lamella in a
hexagonal pattern. Instead of focusing in a sacrificial area, we determined the
defocus after every exposure using a routine implemented in SerialEM modeled
after CTFFind. The focus was then adjusted based on the difference between
desired and measured defocus. Since we used a serpentine pattern for data
collection every exposure is close to the previous exposure making drastic
changes in the defocus unlikely. Furthermore we started our acquisition pattern
on the platinum deposition edge, so the initial exposure where the defocus was
not yet adjusted did not contain any biologically relevant information. 

We used this strategy to collect data on 8 lamella, 4 using the eucentric focus
condition and 4 using the fringe-free condition. We were able to highly
consistently collect data with a defocus of 8 um (Figure 2D), both in the
eucentric focus and fringe-free focus condition. Together with the nominal
defocus of the microscope this data results in a topological map of the lamella.
To ensure that data was collected consistently, we mapped defocus values as a
function of the applied Beam-image shift (Figure 2E). This demonstrated that the
defocus was consistent over the lamella, with outliers only at isolated images
and in images containing contamination. We also plotted the measure objective
astigmatism of the lamella and found that it varies with the applied Beam-image
shift, become more astigmatic mostly due to beam-image shift in the X
direction. While approaches exist to correct this during the data-collection, we
opted to not use these mechanism for these early experiments and instead rely on
computational correction of these aberrations in order to characterize them. 

### 2D-Template matching of cryo-EMILIA data reveals ribosome distribution 

We developed customized preprocessing protocol to images obtained by cryo-EMILIA
to enable their use for 2D-template matching. First we restricted calculation of
cross-correlation coefficients between individual movie frames to the central
portion of the image to prevent artifacts from the beam edges on estimation of
motion. Then we calculated a mask that defined the illuminated area of the
micrographs and used it to fill non-illumated areas with gaussian noise,
matching mean and standard deviation to the illuminated signal (Figure 3A). The
so processed images were suitable for 2D-template matching and we were able to
obtained matches with the same model used for the data in Figure 1.
