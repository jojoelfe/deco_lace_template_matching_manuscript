## Discussion

- Elizabeth Wright and Grant Jensen Montage tomography papers, Papers accelerating tomography using BIS. However, none provide the complete cell bioloical context like DeCo-Lace

- Waffle method for higher throughput, automation of fib-milling

- Throughput and bottlenecks

- lamella mechanical properties, radiation damage, other ways to to thin?

- eucentric vs fringe free illumination

- Visual proteomics

- Granules containing ribosomes?

- Threshold implications (no matches on most images)

- K3 not linear

- why is beam image-shift no affecting us

We found that even though we used beam-image shift extensively (up to 7 um), we did not see substantially reduced 2DTM SNR values in tiles acquired at high beam-image shift compared to tiles acquired with low or no beam image-shift. This is in contrast to reports in single-particle analysis (SPA) [@doi:10.1107/S2052252520013482] where not correcting for the induced beam-tilt substantially reduced the resolution. It is possible that 2DTM is less sensitive to the aberration, since the template is free of any aberration and only the image is distorted. In SPA the beam tilt will affect both the images and the reconstructed template.
