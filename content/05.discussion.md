## Discussion

- eucentric vs fringe free illumination

- Elizabeth Wright and Grant Jensen Montage tomography papers, Papers accelerating tomography using BIS. However, none provide the complete cell bioloical context like DeCo-Lace

The requirement to increase throughput in cryo-EM data collection of cellular samples has been recognized in the recent literature. Most approaches describe so far are tailored towards tomography. [] and [] describe appraoches to increase the FOV of tomogram data-collection by using a montaging technique, in the case of [] using a similar "condensed-beam" appraoch as described here. However, the montages are of substantially smaller scope, covering carbon film holes of 2 um diameter. Others are using beam image-shift to collect tilt-series in multiple location in parallel [] and []. However, they do not provide the foll coverage that can be achieved using Deco-Lace.

- Waffle method for higher throughput, automation of fib-milling

Visual proteomics will require much higher throughput. One milestone would be imaging enough data to represent one cellular volume, which for a small eukaryotic cells requires imaging approximatly 100 lamella, an order of magnitude more data than presented here. While data collection on the TEM is fundamentally limited by the exposure time, this amount of data could be collected within x hours, if the data acquisition scheme were to be improved to perform all nescessary calculation in parallel with actual acquisition. Sample prepration using a FIB/SEM is also currently a bottleneck, but preparation of large lamella with multiple cellular cross-sections using methods like WAFFLE [] might allow this throughput. As stated above, at least for 2DTM computation will remain challenging and require approximately 17,000 GPU hours would be required for a 100 lamella dataset.




- Granules containing ribosomes?

- Threshold implications (no matches on most images)

As describe in [] the 2DTM SNR threshold for detecting a target is chosen to to result in on fal-se positive per image searched. We would therefore expect to find on false positive per tile. We reasoned that the large nuclear area imaged by DeCo-Lace coule be used to test whether this assumption is true. In the 670 tiles containing exclusively nucleus (as manually annotated from the overview image) we detected 247 targets, so our false-positive rate is more then twofold lower than expected. Since earlier work shows that 2DTM can produce matches to nuclera ribosome biogenesis intermediates [], this could even be an overestimate of the false-positive rate. This suggests that the detection threshold could be chosen even more aggressively, which is an area of ongoing research.

- K3 not linear

As mentioned in the result we found a consisten pattern in shading in our montages, that we believe is the result of non-linear behavior of the K3 camera. Indeed, when we average images with a condensed beam taken over vacuum we found in both focus conditions a consistent background pattern with a brighter region a the sides of the illuminated area (Fig []). This might be caused by dynamic adjustment of the counting threshold that expects columns of the sensor to be evenly illuminated as is the case for SPA applications. Since this pattern is of very low resolution it is unlikely to affect 2DTM, but it demonstrates that imaging of heterogeneous samples and unusual illumination schemes cannot rely on linear behavior of the imaging sensor.

- why is beam image-shift no affecting us

We found that even though we used beam-image shift extensively (up to 7 um), we did not see substantially reduced 2DTM SNR values in tiles acquired at high beam-image shift compared to tiles acquired with low or no beam image-shift. This is in contrast to reports in single-particle analysis (SPA) [@doi:10.1107/S2052252520013482] where not correcting for the induced beam-tilt substantially reduced the resolution. It is possible that 2DTM is less sensitive to the aberration, since the template is free of any aberration and only the image is distorted. In SPA the beam tilt will affect both the images and the reconstructed template.
