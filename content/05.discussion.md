## Discussion

In this study we developed an approach to image entire cellular cross-section using cryo-EM at high enough resolution to allow for 2DTM detection of the LSU. The two main advantages compared to previous approaches are high throughput of imaging and biological context for detected molecules. The requirement to increase throughput in cryo-EM data collection of cellular samples has been recognized in the recent literature. Most approaches described so far are tailored towards tomography. Peck et al. [@doi:10.1016/j.jsb.2022.107860] and Yang et al. [@doi:10.1101/2021.12.31.474669] developed approaches to increase the FOV of tomogram data-collection by using a montaging technique. Peck et al. used a similar "condensed-beam" approach as described here. However, the montages are substantially smaller in scope, covering carbon film holes of 2 Âµm diameter. Bouvette et al. [@doi:10.1038/s41467-021-22251-8] and Eisenstein et al. [@doi:10.1101/2022.04.07.487557] are using beam image-shift to collect tilt-series in multiple locations in parallel to increase throughput. However, none of these approaches provide the full coverage of a cellular cross-section that can be achieved using DeCo-LACE.

We observed granules containing a vesicle of putative cytosolic origin. We speculate that upon degranulation, the process in which granules fuse with the plasma membrane, these vesicles would be released into the extracelullar space. The main types of extracellular vesicles of this size are exosomes, up to 100 nm large vesicles derived from fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane, and microvesicles, which are derived from direct budding of the plasma membrane [@doi:10.1038/nrm.2017.125]. We suggest that granulocytes could release a third type of extracellular vesicle, granule-derived vesicles (GDV), into the extracellular space. 2DTM showed that a subset of GDVs can contain ribosomes (Fig. [@fig:matching_euc]F, Fig. [@fig:matching_fff]D,E). This could indicate that these vesicles are transporting translation-capable mRNAs, as has been described for exosomes [@doi:10.1038/ncb1596]. Further studies will be necessary to confirm the existence of GDVs in granulocytes isolated from mammals and to understand their functional significance.

As mentioned in the results, we found a consistent shading artifact pattern in our montages, that we believe is the result of non-linear behavior of the K3 camera. Indeed, when we average images with a condensed beam taken over vacuum we found in both focus conditions a consistent background pattern with a brighter region on the periphery of the illuminated area (Fig [@fig:gain]). This might be caused by dynamic adjustment of the internal camera counting threshold which expects columns of the sensor to be evenly illuminated as is the case for SPA applications. Since the signal of this pattern has mainly low-resolution components it is unlikely to affect 2DTM. However, it highlights that the non-linear behavior of the camera has to be taken into account when imaging samples with strongly varying density and unusual illumination schemes. 

We found that even though we used beam image-shift extensively (up to 7 um), we did not see substantially reduced 2DTM SNR values in tiles acquired at high beam image-shift compared to tiles acquired with low or no beam image-shift. This is in contrast to reports in single-particle analysis (SPA) [@doi:10.1107/S2052252520013482] where the induced beam tilt substantially reduced the resolution if it was not corrected during processing. It is possible that 2DTM is less sensitive to beam-tilt aberrations, since the template is free of any aberration and only the image is distorted, while in SPA the beam tilt will affect both the images and the reconstructed template.

Since we observed substantial variation in LSU density within and between lamellae, visual proteomics studies that use cryo-EM to establish changes in molecular organization within cells will require orders of magnitude more data than used in this study. One milestone would be to image enough data to represent one cellular volume, which for a small eukaryotic cells requires imaging approximately 100 lamellae. While data collection throughput on the TEM is fundamentally limited by the exposure time, this amount of data could be collected within 12 hours by improving the data acquisition scheme to perform all necessary calculations in parallel with actual exposure of the camera. Sample preparation using a FIB/SEM is also currently a bottleneck, but preparation of large lamellae with multiple cellular cross-sections using methods like WAFFLE [@doi:10.1038/s41467-022-29501-3] might allow sufficient throughput. As stated in the results, at least for 2DTM computation will remain challenging and approximately 17,000 GPU hours would be required for a 100 lamellae dataset.
