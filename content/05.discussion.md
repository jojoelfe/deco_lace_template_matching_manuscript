## Discussion

In this study we developed an approach to image entire cellular cross-section using cryo-EM at high enough resolution to allow for 2DTM detection of the LSU. The two main advantages compared to previous approaches are a high throughput of imaging and the biological context for detected molecules. The requirement to increase throughput in cryo-EM data collection of cellular samples has been recognized in the recent literature. Most approaches describeb so far are tailored towards tomography. Peck et al. [@doi:10.1016/j.jsb.2022.107860] and Yang et al.[@doi:10.1101/2021.12.31.474669] developed approaches to increase the FOV of tomogram data-collection by using a montaging technique, in the case of Peck at al. using a similar "condensed-beam" approach as described here. However, the montages are substantially smaller in scope, covering carbon film holes of 2 um diameter. Bouvette et al. [@doi:10.1038/s41467-021-22251-8] and Eisenstein et al. [@doi:10.1101/2022.04.07.487557] are using beam image-shift to collect tilt-series in multiple location in parallel. However, none of these approaches provide the full coverage of a cellular cross-section that can be achieved using DeCo-Lace.

Since we observed substantial variation in ribosome density within and between lamella, visual proteomics studies that use cryo-EM to establish changes in molecular organization within cells will require orders of magnitude more data than used in this study. One milestone would be imaging enough data to represent one cellular volume, which for a small eukaryotic cells requires imaging approximately 100 lamella. While data collection throughput on the TEM is fundamentally limited by the exposure time, this amount of data could be collected within 12 hours, if the data acquisition scheme were to be improved to perform all necessary calculation in parallel with actual exposure of the sensor. Sample preparation using a FIB/SEM is also currently a bottleneck, but preparation of large lamellae with multiple cellular cross-sections using methods like WAFFLE [@doi:10.1038/s41467-022-29501-3] might allow sufficient throughput. As stated in the results, at least for 2DTM computation will remain challenging and approximately 17,000 GPU hours would be required for a 100 lamellae dataset. 

As described in [@doi:10.7554/eLife.25648] the 2DTM SNR threshold for detecting a target is chosen to to result in on false positive per image searched. We would therefore expect to find on false positive per tile. We reasoned that the large nuclear area imaged by DeCo-Lace could be used to test whether this assumption is true. In the 670 tiles containing exclusively nucleus (as manually annotated from the overview image) we detected 247 targets, so our false-positive rate is more then twofold lower than expected. Since earlier work shows that 2DTM with the LSU can produce matches to nuclear ribosome biogenesis intermediates [@doi:10.1101/2022.04.10.487797], this could even be an overestimate of the false-positive rate. This suggests that the detection threshold could be chosen even more aggressively, which is an area of ongoing research.

We found that even though we used beam image-shift extensively (up to 7 um), we did not see substantially reduced 2DTM SNR values in tiles acquired at high beam image-shift compared to tiles acquired with low or no beam image-shift. This is in contrast to reports in single-particle analysis (SPA) [@doi:10.1107/S2052252520013482] where the induced beam tilt substantially reduced the resolution if it was not corrected during processing. It is possible that 2DTM is less sensitive to beam-tilt aberrations, since the template is free of any aberration and only the image is distorted, while in SPA the beam tilt will affect both the images and the reconstructed template.

As mentioned in the results, we found a consistent pattern in shading in our montages, that we believe is the result of non-linear behavior of the K3 camera. Indeed, when we average images with a condensed beam taken over vacuum we found in both focus conditions a consistent background pattern with a brighter region a the sides of the illuminated area (Fig [@fig:gain]). This might be caused by dynamic adjustment of the counting threshold that expects columns of the sensor to be evenly illuminated as is the case for SPA applications. Since this pattern is of very low resolution it is unlikely to affect 2DTM, but it highlights that imaging of heterogeneous samples and unusual illumination schemes cannot rely on linear behavior of modern imaging sensors.

Unexpectedly, we observed granules containing a vesicle of putative cytosolic origin. We speculate that upon degranulation, the process in which granules fuse with the plasma membrane, these vesicles would be released into the extracelullar space. The main types extracellular vesicles of this size are exosomes, up to 100 nm large vesicles derived from fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane, and microvesicles, which are derived from direct budding of the plasma membrane [@doi:10.1038/nrm.2017.125]. We suggest that granulocytes could release a third type of extracellular vesicle, granule-derived vesicles (GDV), into the extracellular space. 2DTM showed that a subset of GDVs can contain ribosomes (Fig. [@fig:matching_euc]F, Fig. [@fig:matching_fff]D,E), which could indicate that these vesicles are transporting translation-capable mRNAs, as has been described for exosomes [@doi:10.1038/ncb1596]. Further studies will be necessary to confirm the existence of GDVs in granulocytes isolated from mammals and to understand their functional significance.
