## Introduction

A major goal in understanding cellular processes is the knowledge of the
amounts, location, interactions, and conformations of biomolecules
inside the cell. This knowledge can be obtained by approaches broadly
divided into label- and label-free techniques. In label-dependent
techniques a probe is physically attached to a molecule of interest that
is able to detected with a high signal-to-noise signal, such as a
fluorescent molecule. In label-free techniques the physical properties
of molecules themselves are used for detection. An example for this is
proteomics using mass-spectrometry [@doi:10.1038/nbt.1592]. The advantage
of label-free techniques is that they can provide information over
thousands of molecules, while label-techniques offer highly specific
information for a few molecules. Especially spatial information can
often only be achieved using label-dependent techniques, such as
fluorescence microscopy [@doi:10.1038/nmeth817]. 

Cryo-electron microscopy has the potential to directly visualize the
arrangement of atoms that compose biomolecules inside of cells, thereby
allowing label-free detection with high spatial accuracy. This has been
called "visual proteomics" [@doi:10.1038/nrm1861]. Since cryo-EM
requires thin samples (\<500nm), imaging of biomolecules inside cells is
restricted to small organisms, thin regions of cells, or samples that
have been suitably thinned. Thinning can be achieved either by
mechanical sectioning [@doi:10.1111/j.1365-2818.1983.tb04225.x] or by
milling using a focused ion beam (FIB) [@doi:10.1016/j.sbi.2013.08.006]. his complex workflow
leads to a low throughput of cryo-EM imaging of cells and is further
limited by the fact that at the required magnifications, typical fields
of view (FOV) are very small compared to mammalian cells, and the FOV
achieved by label-techniques such as fluorescence light microscopy. The
predominant cryo-EM technique for the localization of biomolecules of
defined size and shape inside cells is cryo-electron tomography [@doi:10.1017/S0033583511000102]. However, the requirement of a tilt series at
every imaged location and subsequent image alignment, severely limits
the throughput for molecular localization.

An alternative approach is to identify molecules by their structural
"fingerprint" in single projection using "2D template-matching" (2DTM)
[@doi:10.7554/eLife.25648; @doi:10.1101/2020.04.22.053868;
@doi:10.7554/eLife.68946]. In this
method a 3D model of a biomolecule is used as a template to find 2D
projections that match the molecules visible in the electron
micrographs. This method requires a projection search on a fine angular
grid, and the projections are used to find local cross-correlation peaks
with the micrograph. Since the location of a biomolecule in the
z-direction causes predictable aberrations to the projection image, this
method can be used to calculate complete 3D coordinates and orientations
of a biomolecule in a cellular sample
[@doi:10.1101/2020.04.22.053868]

Hematopoiesis is the process of generating the various cell types of the blood in
the bone marrow. Disregulation of the process results in diseases like leukemia.
Understanding how hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are programmed to
diffferentiate to the appropriate cell type would be provide new insight how
hematopoiesis can be misregulated. Of special interest is the regulation of
translation during hematopoiesis. This is exemplified by the observation that
genetic defects in the ribosome machinery often leads to hematopoietic
disease[@doi:10.1093/nar/gkz637]. As such direct quantification of ribosome
location, number and conformational states could lead to new insight into
hematopoietic disease [@doi:10.1186/s12885-018-4178-z]. 

Here we apply 2D-template matching of ribosomes to cryo-FIB milled
neutrophil-like murine cells [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2016.08.057]. To increase the
amount of collected data and to provide unbiased sampling of the whole
lamella, we devised a new data-acquisition scheme, Defocus-corrected
large area cryo-electron microscopy (DeCo-LACE). We characterize
aberration cause by the used large beam-image shifts and highly focused
beams and find that they can be adequately corrected to enable ribosome
detection by 2DTM. The resulting data provide a description of ribosome
distribution in the whole lamellae, which represent roughly 2% of the
cellular volume. We find highly heterogeneous density of ribosome within
the cell and can identify discrete clusters of presumably
translationally active ribosomes, by testing for the presence of the
small ribosomal subunit. The high accuracy of location and orientation
of each detected ribosome also allows us to cluster ribosome molecules
into potential polysomes. Analysis of the throughput in this method
suggests that for the foreseeable future computation will be the
bottleneck for visual proteomics.
