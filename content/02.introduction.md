## Introduction

A major goal in understanding cellular processes is the knowledge of the
amounts, location, interactions, and conformations of biomolecules
inside the cell. This knowledge can be obtained by approaches broadly
divided into label- and label-free techniques. In label-dependent
techniques a probe is physically attached to a molecule of interest that
is able to be detected by its strong signal, such as a
fluorescent molecule. In label-free techniques, the physical properties
of molecules themselves are used for detection. An example for this is
proteomics using mass-spectrometry [@doi:10.1038/nbt.1592]. The advantage
of label-free techniques is that they can provide information over
thousands of molecules, while label-dependent techniques offer highly specific
information for a few molecules. Especially spatial information can
often only be achieved using label-dependent techniques, such as
fluorescence microscopy [@doi:10.1038/nmeth817]. 

Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has the potential to directly visualize the
arrangement of atoms that compose biomolecules inside of cells, thereby
allowing label-free detection with high spatial accuracy. This has been
called "visual proteomics" [@doi:10.1038/nrm1861]. Since cryo-EM
requires thin samples (\<500nm), imaging of biomolecules inside cells is
restricted to small organisms, thin regions of cells, or samples that
have been suitably thinned. Thinning can be achieved either by
mechanical sectioning [@doi:10.1111/j.1365-2818.1983.tb04225.x] or by
milling using a focused ion beam (FIB) [@doi:10.1016/j.sbi.2013.08.006]. This complex workflow
leads to a low throughput of cryo-EM imaging of cells and is further
limited by the fact that at the required magnifications, typical fields
of view (FOV) are very small compared to mammalian cells, and the FOV
achieved by label-dependent techniques such as fluorescence light microscopy. The
predominant cryo-EM technique for the localization of biomolecules of
defined size and shape inside cells is cryo-electron tomography [@doi:10.1017/S0033583511000102]. However, the requirement of a tilt series at
every imaged location and subsequent image alignment, severely limits
the throughput for molecular localization.

An alternative approach is to identify molecules by their structural
"fingerprint" in single projection using "2D template-matching" (2DTM)
[@doi:10.7554/eLife.25648; @doi:10.1101/2020.04.22.053868;
@doi:10.7554/eLife.68946]. In this
method, a 3D model of a biomolecule is used as a template to find 2D
projections that match the molecules visible in the electron
micrographs. This method requires a projection search on a fine angular
grid, and the projections are used to find local cross-correlation peaks
with the micrograph. Since the location of a biomolecule in the
z-direction causes predictable aberrations to the projection image, this
method can be used to calculate complete 3D coordinates and orientations
of a biomolecule in a cellular sample
[@doi:10.1101/2020.04.22.053868].

Here we apply 2DTM of the ribosome large subunit (LSU) to cryo-FIB milled
neutrophil-like murine cells [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2016.08.057]. We chose these
 cells because genetic defects in the ribosome machinery often leads to
hematopoietic disease [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkz637] and direct quantification of
ribosome location, number and conformational states in hematopoietic cells could
lead to new insight into hematopoietic disease [@doi:10.1186/s12885-018-4178-z].
To increase the amount of collected data and to provide unbiased sampling of the
whole lamella, we devised a new data-acquisition scheme, "Defocus-Corrected
Large Area Cryo-Electron microscopy" (DeCo-LACE). 2DTM allows us to test whether
aberrations caused by large beam-image shifts and highly condensed beams
deteriorate the high-resolution signal. We find that these aberrations do not
impede LSU detection by 2DTM. The resulting data provide a description of
ribosome distribution in an entire lamella, which represent 1-2% of the cellular
volume. We find a highly heterogeneous density of ribosomes within the cell.
Analysis of the throughput in this method suggests that for the foreseeable
future computation will be the bottleneck for visual proteomics.
