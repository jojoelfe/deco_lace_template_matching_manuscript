## Introduction

Understanding of cellular processes requires knowledge of the amount, location,
and interaction of biomolecules inside the cell. Techniques that measure this
can broadly be divided into label, and label-free techniques. In
label-techniques a probe is physically attached to a molecule is interest that
is able to produce a high signal-to-noise signal, such as a fluorescent probe.
In label-free techniques the physical properties of molecules themselves are
used for detection. An example for this is proteomics using mass-spectrometry.
Broadly the advantage of label-free techniques is that they can provide
information over thousands of molecules, while label-techniques offer higher
fidelity information for a few molecules. Especially spatial information can
most of the time only be achieved using label-techniques. 

Cryo-electron microscopy has the potential to directly measure the arrangement
of atoms that compose biomolecules inside of cells, thereby allowing label-free
detection with high spatial accuracy. This has been called "Visual proteomics".
Since cryo-EM requires thin samples (<500nm), imaging of biomolecules inside
cells is either restricted to small organism and thin regions of large cells or
requires thinning of the sample. This can be achieved either by mechanical
sectioning [cite] or by milling using a focused ion beam (FIB) [cite]. This
complex workflow restricts throughpute of cryo-EM. This is exacerbated by the
fact that at the required magnification typical field of views (FOV) are very
small compared to mammalian cells and the FOV achieved by label-techniques such
as fluorescence light microscopy. The predominant technique for detection of
biomolecules according to their shape in cells at the moment is cryo-electron
tomography. However, the requirement of physically tilt the stage at every FOV,
together with a more complex workflw that requires highly accurate lignment of
various projection, further restricts the throughput for molecular detection. 

An alternative approach is to identify molecules  by their structural "fingerprint" in
single projection using "2D template-matching" [cite]. In this methods an
experimentally obtained 
3D model of a biomolecule is used to calculate the expected electron density,
which is called the template. The template is then projected on a fine angular
grid and the projection are used to find local cross-correlation peaks in a
cryo-EM micrograph. Since locations of the biomolecule in teh Z-direction causes
predictable aberrations to the projection image, this method can be used to
calculate 3D coordinates and orientations of a biomolecule in a cellular sample [cite]

Hematopoiesis is the process of generating the various cell typs of the blood in
the bone marrow. Disregulation of the process results in diseases like leukemia.
Understaning how hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are programmed to
diffferentiate to the appropriate cell type would be provide new insight how
hematopoiesis can be misregulated. Of special interest is the regulation of
translation during hematopoiesis. This is exemplified by the observation that
genetic defects in the ribosome machinery often leads to hematopoietic disease.
As such direct quantification of ribosome location, number and conformational
states could lead to new insight into hematopoietic disease. 

Here we apply 2D-template matching to neutrophil-ilke murine cells. By employing
anew data-acquisition scheme, Defocus-adjusted large area cryo-electron
microscopy (DeCo-LACE) we obtained coverage of the whole "lamella"
covering roughly 2% of the cellular volume.
