![Motion correction of movies with condensed beams. 
At the top of each panel is an average of the movie that was motion-corrected
with a red dashed box indicating the region that was used to estimate shifts.
Below is a graph indicating the estimated shifts of the individual frames of the
movie. Below this is the MIP of 2DTM using the large subunit of the mouse ribosome.
(A) Motion correction of the whole movie
(B) Notion correction of a cropped region of the movie that eliminates the beam
edges
(C) Motion correction of the whole movie, using only the central region to
estimate the shifts
