![Motion correction of movies with condensed beams. 
At the top of each panel is an average of the movie that was motion-corrected
with a red dashed box indicating the region that was used to estimate shifts.
Below is a graph indicating the estimated shifts of the individual frames of the
movie. Below this is the MIP of 2DTM using the large subunit of the mouse ribosome.
(A) Motion correction of the whole movie
(B) Notion correction of a cropped region of the movie that eliminates the beam
edges
(C) Motion correction of the whole movie, using only the central region to
estimate the shifts
(D) Representative result of 2DTM (botttom) on uncorrected micrographs.
Detections along the beam edge are artifacts due to the high-contrast signal.
(E) Micrographs after preprocessing for 2DTM (top). The micrograph has been cropped to
the perimeter of the beam and unilluminated areas of the image have been replace
by Gaussian noise. After running 2DTM on this micrograph (bottom) no more artifactual
detections are observed.

![Motion correction of individual tiles imaged using the DeCo-LACE approach
(A) Total estimated motion of individual micrographs taken using the DeCo-LACE approach
plotted as a function of the beam image-shift values. 
(B) Sample thickness estimate of individual micrographs taken using the DeCo-LACE approach
plotted as a function of the beam image-shift values. Sample thickness was
estimated using Lamber-Beers law using a coefficient of 322 nm [@doi:10.1016/j.jsb.2018.06.007].
(C) Distance between highest and lowest LSU detection in each micrograph plotted
as a function of estimated sample thickness. Dashed black line indicates unity
and red dashed line is drawn in parallel with an x intercept of 70 nm. Most
data points fall below the red dashed line, indicating that no detections occur
within 35 nm of the lamella edge.
