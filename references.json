Advances in instrumentation and methodology in recent decades have now enabled electron tomography to become the highest resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging technique available for unique objects such as cells. Cells can be imaged either plastic-embedded or frozen-hydrated. Then the series of projection images are aligned and back-projected to generate a 3D reconstruction or ‘tomogram’. Here, we review how electron tomography has begun to reveal the molecular organization of cells and how the existing and upcoming technologies promise even greater insights into structural cell biology.</jats:p>",

Eliminating biochemical isolation steps required by other techniques, this method opens up the cell to in-situ structural studies. However, the need to compensate for errors in targeting introduced during mechanical navigation of the specimen significantly slows down tomographic data collection thus limiting its practical value. Here, we introduce protocols for tilt-series acquisition and processing that accelerate data collection speed by up to an order of magnitude and improve map resolution compared to existing approaches. We achieve this by using beam-image shift to multiply the number of areas imaged at each stage position, by integrating geometrical constraints during imaging to achieve high precision targeting, and by performing per-tilt astigmatic CTF estimation and data-driven exposure weighting to improve final map resolution. We validated our beam image-shift electron cryo-tomography (BISECT) approach by determining the structure of a low molecular weight target (~300 kDa) at 3.6 Å resolution where density for individual side chains is clearly resolved.</jats:p>",

However, challenges remain in conventional cryo-FIB/SEM workflows, including milling thick specimens with vitrification issues, specimens with preferred orientation, low-throughput when milling small and/or low concentration specimens, and specimens that distribute poorly across grid squares. Here we present a general approach called the ‘Waffle Method’ which leverages high-pressure freezing to address these challenges. We illustrate the mitigation of these challenges by applying the Waffle Method and cryo-ET to reveal the macrostructure of the polar tube in microsporidian spores in multiple complementary orientations, which was previously not possible due to preferred orientation. We demonstrate the broadness of the Waffle Method by applying it to three additional cellular samples and a single particle sample using a variety of cryo-FIB-milling hardware, with manual and automated approaches. We also present a unique and critical stress-relief gap designed specifically for waffled lamellae. We propose the Waffle Method as a way to achieve many advantages of cryo-liftout on the specimen grid while avoiding the long, challenging, and technically-demanding process required for cryo-liftout.</jats:p>",

Human neutrophils contain two basic types of granules, azurophils and specifics, which differ in morphology, contents, and time of origin. Azurophils are large and may be spherical or ellipsoid, the latter with a crystalline inclusion. They are produced in the first secretory stage (promyelocyte), contain peroxidase and various lysosomal enzymes, and thus correspond to modified primary lysosomes. Specifics are smaller, may be spherical or elongated, and are formed during a later secretory stage (myelocyte). They lack lysosomal enzymes and contain alkaline phosphatase and basic protein; their contents remain largely undetermined. Specifics outnumber azurophils in the mature PMN because of reduction in numbers of azurophils per cell by cell division in the myelocyte stage. The findings indicate that the situation is basically the same as described previously in the rabbit, insofar as the origin, enzymic activity, and persistence in the mature cell of the two types (azurophil and specific) of granules are concerned. The main difference between PMN of the two species is in the morphology (size, shape, and density) of the granules, especially the azurophils.</jats:p>",

Intriguingly, congenital ribosomopathies display a paradoxical transition from early symptoms due to cellular hypo-proliferation to an elevated cancer risk later in life. Another association between ribosome defects and cancer came into view after the recent discovery of somatic mutations in ribosomal proteins and rDNA copy number changes in a variety of tumor types, giving rise to somatic ribosomopathies. Despite these clear connections between ribosome defects and cancer, the molecular mechanisms by which defects in this essential cellular machinery are oncogenic only start to emerge. In this review, the impact of ribosomal defects on the cellular function and their mechanisms of promoting oncogenesis are described. In particular, we discuss the emerging hallmarks of ribosomopathies such as the appearance of ‘onco-ribosomes’ that are specialized in translating oncoproteins, dysregulation of translation-independent extra-ribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins, rewired cellular protein and energy metabolism, and extensive oxidative stress leading to DNA damage. We end by integrating these findings in a model that can provide an explanation how ribosomopathies could lead to the transition from hypo- to hyper-proliferation in bone marrow failure syndromes with elevated cancer risk.</jats:p>",

We used a library of images— calculated on the basis of known structural data—as search templates to detect targets as small as the “head” domain (350 kDa) of the ribosome’s small subunit in single-tilt electron cryo-micrographs by cellular high resolution template matching (cHRTM). Atomically precise position and orientation estimates reveal the conformation of individual ribosomes and enable the detection of specifically bound ligands down to 24 kDa. We show that highly head-swivelled states are likely to play a role in mRNA translocation in living cells. cHRTM outperforms cryo-electron tomography three-fold in sensitivity and completely avoids the vicissitudes of exogenous labelling.</jats:p>",

This severely limits the possibilities for recording tomographic tilt series in a high-throughput manner. Here, we utilise a geometrical sample model and optical image shift to record tens of tilt series in parallel, thereby saving time and gaining sample areas conventionally used for tracking of specimen movement. The parallel cryo electron tomography (PACE-tomo) method achieves a throughput faster than 5 min per tilt series and allows the collection of sample areas that were previously unreachable, thus maximising the amount of data from each lamella. Performance testing with ribosomes <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> on state-of-the-art and general-purpose microscopes demonstrated the high-throughput and high-quality of PACE-tomo.</jats:p>",

However, in practice, the utility of <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> cryo-EM is limited by the difficulty of reliably locating and confidently identifying molecular targets (particles) and their conformational states in the crowded cellular environment. We recently showed that 2DTM, a fine-grained template-based search applied to cryo-EM micrographs, can localize particles in two-dimensional views of cells with high precision. Here we demonstrate that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observed with 2DTM can be used to differentiate related complexes in focused ion beam (FIB)-milled cell sections. We apply this method in two contexts to locate and classify related intermediate states of 60S ribosome biogenesis in the <jats:italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</jats:italic> cell nucleus. In the first, we separate the nuclear pre-60S population from the cytoplasmic mature 60S population, using the subcellular localization to validate assignment. In the second, we show that relative 2DTM SNRs can be used to separate mixed populations of nuclear pre-60S that are not visually separable. We use a maximum likelihood approach to define the probability of each particle belonging to each class, thereby establishing a statistic to describe the confidence of our classification. Without the need to generate 3D reconstructions, 2DTM can be applied even when only a few target particles exist in a cell.</jats:p>",

The `frozen plasmon' method is introduced to explicitly model spatially variable inelastic scattering processes in cryo-EM specimens. This approach produces amplitude contrast that depends on the atomic composition of the specimen, reproduces the total inelastic mean free path as observed experimentally and allows for the incorporation of radiation damage in the simulation. These improvements are quantified using the matched filter concept to compare simulation and experiment. The frozen plasmon method, in combination with a new mathematical formulation for accurately sampling the tabulated atomic scattering potentials onto a Cartesian grid, is implemented in the open-source software package <jats:italic>cis</jats:italic>TEM.</jats:p>",

This context can be visualized at nanometer resolution in three dimensions (3D) using electron cryo-tomography, which requires tilt series to be recorded and computationally aligned, currently limiting throughput. Additionally, the high-resolution signal preserved in the raw tomograms is currently limited by a number of technical difficulties, leading to an increased false-positive detection rate when using 3D template matching to find molecular complexes in tomograms. We have recently described a 2D template matching approach that addresses these issues by including high-resolution signal preserved in single-tilt images. A current limitation of this approach is the high computational cost that limits throughput. We describe here a GPU-accelerated implementation of 2D template matching in the image processing software <jats:italic>cis</jats:italic>TEM that allows for easy scaling and improves the accessibility of this approach. We apply 2D template matching to identify ribosomes in images of frozen-hydrated <jats:italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</jats:italic> cells with high precision and sensitivity, demonstrating that this is a versatile tool for in situ visual proteomics and in situ structure determination. We benchmark the results with 3D template matching of tomograms acquired on identical sample locations and identify strengths and weaknesses of both techniques, which offer complementary information about target localization and identity.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Communication between the 5' cap structure and 3' poly(A) tail of eukaryotic mRNA results in the synergistic enhancement of translation. The cap and poly(A) tail binding proteins, eIF4E and Pab1p, mediate this effect in the yeast S. cerevisiae through their interactions with different parts of the translation factor eIF4G. Here, we demonstrate the reconstitution of an eIF4E/eIF4G/Pab1p complex with recombinant proteins, and show by atomic force microscopy that the complex can circularize capped, polyadenylated RNA. Our results suggest that formation of circular mRNA by translation factors could contribute to the control of mRNA expression in the eukaryotic cell.",
